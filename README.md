## Notes
Add any important notes about running files/setup commands here.

### Model Training
```model``` folder from ```Lab_Files/Week06-07/network/scripts``` has been removed as they are too big to upload. 
I have zipped it up and put them on the slack channel so if you need them you can access from there then add them to your local copy.

### Rebuilding the catkin_ws
Has not been included here as there was complications with building the workspace then loading to Github.There is a copy of the latest ```catkin_ws``` on the slack channel if you need it. You will likely have to rebuild the catkin workspace if you do so(instructions can be found in install guide on main ECE4078 Lab repo).
